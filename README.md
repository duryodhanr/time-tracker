## Time Tracker

Time tracking web app created with ReactJS for UI and MomentJS for date/time manipulation.

### To Do
- Create a simple backend to authenticate users/store work logs
- Add some default prop types to aid in type errors
- Add some more in depth tests for internal components
- Potentially refactor out some of the TimeTracker component into smaller components.
- Look into Redux for global state management.
